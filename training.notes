# Currently tests:
- Hidden layer size of 256 shows progress (loss is based on state.q[2])

- setting std to zero makes rewards nans why. I wonder if there NEEDS to be randomization in the enviornment

- ctrl cost is whats giving nans? interesting?
- it is unrelated to randomization of enviornmnet. i think gradient related

- first thing to become nans seems to be actor loss and scores. after that, everything becomes nans

- fixed entropy epsilon. hope this works now.
